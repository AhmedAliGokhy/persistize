Persistize
==========

Just like ''memoize'' but stores the value as an attribute in the database. Updates the field each time the record is saved:

  class Person < ActiveRecord::Base
    
    def full_name
      "#{first_name} #{last_name}"
    end
    
    persistize :full_name
    
  end
  
  ...
  
  Person.create(:first_name => 'Jimi', :last_name => 'Hendrix')
  Person.find_by_full_name('Jimi Hendrix')
  
This example is just one of the possible applications of this pattern, your imagination is the limit =;-) If you can find a
better example, please send it to us.
